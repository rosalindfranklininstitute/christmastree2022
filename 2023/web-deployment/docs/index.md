title: Santa's Workshop 2.0 - AI's Christmas Dream 2023 
ᴴₒᴴₒᴴₒ: true

Earlier this year the RSEs (Research Software Elves) in Santa's workshop were having a dilemma. The old model they used to decide if a child was "Naughty" or "Nice" had been running in production for 10 years and was no longer suitable! They reached out to their collaborators in the AI theme at the Rosalind Franklin Institute to design them a new model to make sure that they could find all the good children and process their letters to Santa in time for Christmas...

The AI Team put their heads together, and came up with a Neural Network to replace the out of date decision tree that the elves had previously been using. The elves asked for the new model to be sent to them via a magic Christmas tree that will deliver the new model on the 1st December.

Our christmas tree this year has two faces:

1. The current Decision Tree used by the elves, play along ... are you Naughty or Nice?
2. A representation of the new neural network we are sending to replace it. 

Enjoy our entry this year... And Merry Christmas from all at the AI Theme!
