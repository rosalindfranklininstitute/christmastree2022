We have decorated our tree using the beauty of crystallography and imaging that underpins so much of our science at the Franklin. This year we have made baubles that are the diffraction patterns of snowflakes and have programmed our lights to represent sinograms that are used in discovering protein structures. </p> <pre><code>def seasons_greetings( a_friend ):\n    print( f\"Merry Christmas to {a_friend}\")\n\nseasons_greetings( \"to all Franklin Staff!\")\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"sinogram_lights/","title":"Sinogram Lights","text":"<p> WARNING: CONTAINS MATHEMATICAL CONCEPTS </p> <p>In tomography a 3D image is reconstructed from an angular series of projections through that object, called a line intergral or Radon Transform. Look at the diagram below and you can see the projections of a christmas pudding in a tin that is being rotated through a beam.  If we look at these line itergrals over the angular projections we get a Sinogram. The wavey lines of the sinogram in the plot at the top right of the pudding image show the types of patterns we get from tomography. </p> <p>Sinograms play a big role in tomography, and are critical to get a good reconstruction of your data. Sinograms are very beautiful and don't get the appreciation they deserve. When simulated, sinograms give us  very nice twinkly patterns that we can render in lights. Here we have simulated sinograms and then programmed the lights to show you these lovely patterns. A bit of an abstract concept but worth it!</p>"},{"location":"snowflake_diffraction/","title":"Snowflake Diffraction","text":"<p>In much of electron microscope and x-ray imaging we measure the diffraction patterns of the object and use a computer program to recreate the structures from the diffraction pattern. Diffraction is a phenomenon that occurs when a wave passes through an aperture, a similar size to it's wavelength. You can see this in picture of the bay below (https://www.flickr.com/photos/ozzrod/33811299806), where the distance of the cliffs is equivalent to the wavelengths of the waves passing through.</p>  <p>Luckily for us, the wavelength of x-rays and electrons match the spaces between atoms or molecules in a crystal , which is what allows us to image them. The diffraction pattern is related to the structure of the object that made it by a mathematical expression called the Fourier Transform. So if we measure the diffraction patterns emerging from crystals we can use Fourier Theory to infer their structure. In our wave example above the Fourier Transform of the gap in the cliffs gives the curved shape we see in the waves. </p> <p>Diffraction patterns are very beautiful and we don't look at  them often, instead focussing on the molecular structures that they gives us. AI has used this opportunity to give diffraction patterns a chance to shine by simulating the diffraction patterns of these beautiful snowflakes and then using that to create decorations. The images below show the images of the snowflakes and the diffraction patterns that were made from them.  </p> <p>We then used blurring and thresholding techniques to create masks from the intricate diffraction that we could then use to create christmas tree decorations. Some were painted onto baubles with metallic paints, and some were laser cut out of wood.
