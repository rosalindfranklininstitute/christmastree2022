# Sinogram Lights

** WARNING: CONTAINS MATHEMATICAL CONCEPTS **

In tomography a 3D image is reconstructed from an angular series of projections through that object, called a line intergral or Radon Transform. Look at the diagram below and you can see the projections of a christmas pudding in a tin that is being rotated through a beam.  We can track the positional changes in these Radon Transforms as the object is rotated and plot them, this object is called a sinogram. 

Sinograms play a big role in tomography, looking at them can help us identify the alignment of our sample and also what form it might take when reconstructed. Sinograms are very beautiful and don't get the appreciation they deserve. When simulated, sinograms give us  very nice twinkly patterns that we can render in lights. Here we have simulated sinograms and then programmed the lights to show you these lovely patterns. A bit of an abstract concept but worth it!
