# Welcome to Christmas Dream 2022

This year the theme of the AI tree is Xmas-tallography. We have decorated our tree using the beauty of crystallography and imaging that underpins so much of our science at the Franklin. This year we have made baubles that are the [diffraction patterns of snowflakes](#Snowflake Diffraction) and have programmed our [lights to represent sinograms](#Sinogram Lights) that are used in discovering protein structures. 

	

```python
def seasons_greetings( a_friend ):
    print( f"Merry Christmas to {a_friend}")

seasons_greetings( "to all Franklin Staff!")
```
