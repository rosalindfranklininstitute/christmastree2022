# christmastree2022
To collate the work that we have done of the Christmas tree designs 2022's Christmas tree decorating competition

# Intro

This year the AI team will submit two Christmas Trees into the competition, the code, issues and docs surrounding the Christmas tree will be gathered here.

## Tree 1: Born-in-a-Stable Diffusion

This tree will have:
* 3D printed/modelling clay tree ornaments of our Project Animals doing Christmassy things
* The images to 3D print will be generated via Stable Diffusion and mapped to 3D using this project: https://dreamfusion3d.github.io/
* We will have the `christmasdream.rfi.ac.uk` website running where users can see the Stable diffusion model outcomes and maybe create their own?
* A tablet will be next to the tree to display this
* You can use the star with the QR code to get to `christmasdream.rfi.ac.uk`

## Tree 2: Xmas-tallography
This tree will have:
* programmable lights running sinogram patterns
* Ornaments that are made by laser cutting/Macrame/Crochet/paper-cutting FFT's of christmas images i.e. snowflakes into glass or acrylic
* The FFT's will be generated from code published in this repo.
